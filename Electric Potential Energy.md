# Stored energy due to an electric charge, measured in [[Joule]]
### Its a type of [[Potential Energy]]
### Equation
$$EPE = U_E = k\frac{q_1*q_2}r$$
EPE = [[Electric Potential Energy]]
U = Energy in [[Joule]]
q = [[Charge]] in [[Coulomb]]
r = Distance in [[Meter]]
### EPE is a scalar
- Just magnitude, no direction (okay with +/-)

### EPE is dependent on
- Distance between charges
- Size of charge
- Sign is dependent on sign of charges

### [[Fundamental rule of Electrostatics]] means that charges can have forces when interacting
