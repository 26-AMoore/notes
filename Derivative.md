# The derivative of $f$ at $x=a$ is the slope of the tangent line to $y=f(x)$ at point $(a, f(a))$ 

Difference Quotient -  Slope of the [[Secant]] line
$$\frac{{f(a)-f(x)}}{a-x}$$

Slope of the [[Tangent]] line - Derivative
$$\lim_{ a \to x } \frac{{f(a)-f(x)}}{a-x}$$
at $a=x$ this equal $\frac{0}{0}$

#### Also can be written as
$$\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{{f(a+h) - f(a)}}{h}$$
#### Derivative notation is
$$f'(x)\ or\ \frac{dy}{dx}$$
