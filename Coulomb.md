# Measurement of the Relationship between charge and electric force 
## Measured in (C) but is stupidly large
- m-milli = $10^{-3}$
- $\mu$-micro = $10^{-6}$
- n-nano = $10^{-9}$
Ex. $8\mu c$ = $8*10^{-3}C$


Found by Charles-Augustine de Coulomb
## [[Charge]] of [[Protons]] and [[Electrons]] are equal at $e=+/-1.6*10^{-19}C$
