#### Arrhenius Definitions
##### Acid
Substances that produce h$^+$ ions (`dissociate`) when they dissolve in water

Has an H, and -> into singular H$^+$
substace -> other substace H$^+$
###### Hydronium ion
and H$^+$ ion that attaches to a water molocule, as they can __not___ exist by themselves in a solution with lone pairs

##### Base
Ionic compounds that `dissociate` into __cations +__ and __hydroxide -__ ions when they dissolve in water
###### Ex
Ca (OH)$_2$ -> Ca$^+$ & 2(OH)$^-$
Al(OH)$_3$ -> Al$^+$ & 3(OH)$^-$

#### BrÃ¸nsted-Lowry Definitions (Acid Base Partners)
##### Acid
A substance that donates H$^+$
##### Base
A substance that accepts H$^+$

One substance is the H$^+$ donor, the other is water
HCl (donor) + H$_2$O -> H$_3$O$^+$ + Cl$^-$

NH$_3$ (base) + H$_2$O (acid) <=> NH$_4^+$ + OH$^-$ (hydroxide)

H2O + H2O -> OH- + H3O+
wtf man, why is the first one the acid

###### Amphoteric
A substance that can be an Acid or a base

#### pH = -log(H$_3$O$^+$)

###### Strong v. Weak Acids
Strong acids completly dissociate into H$^+$ ions

Weak acids
