Particles move randomly in straight paths at high speeds
Average kinetic energy is proportional to Kelvin
They hit stuff, exerting pressure on it
Attraction between the molocules is small
The volume of the particles is extremely small compared to the space occupied by the gas
So, gas fills the entire container

Balloon == change in moles -> pressure 
Marshmallows == change in pressure -> volume
Heat flask == change in temp -> change in pressure
Balloon but cold == change in temp -> pressure && volume
