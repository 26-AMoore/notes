# What is a mole?
**1 mole** = 6.022 x 10$^{23}$ representative particles

- An element is made up of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">atoms</mark>
- 1 mole of Aluminum contains 6.02 x 1023 Al atoms
- 1 mole of Aluminum has a mass of 26.98 g
- The molar mass of Al is 26.98 g/mol

- An ionic compound is based on <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">formula units</mark>
- 1 mole of NaCl contains 6.02 x 1023 formula units
- 1 mole of NaCl has a mass of 22.99 g + 35.45 g = 58.44 g
- The molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol

- A molecular compounds is made up of molecules
- 1 mole of a H$_2$O contains 6.02 x 1023  molecules
- 1 mole of H$_2$O has a mass of 2 x 1.01 g + 16.00 g = 18.02 g
- The molar mass of H$_2$O is 18.02 g/mol

## Molar Mass: 
- Mass in grams of one mole of a substance (g/mol)
