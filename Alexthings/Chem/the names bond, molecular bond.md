## Intra(within) vs. Inter(between)
### Intra
Ionic bonds 
covelant bonds

### Inter
Dipole Dipole
	Occurs in polar molocules
	When electrons permanently shift
Hydrogen bonds
	Occurs in polar molocules
	Occurs when H bonds to N, O, F
	H in one molocule is attrachet to a lone pair in another molocule
Dispersion
	London Dispersion Forces (LDF)
	Temporary dipole between all types of molocules
