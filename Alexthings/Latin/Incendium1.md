As I was traveling around a different part of the province, a massive fire devastated many private homes and two public buildings in Nicomedia, despite there being a road in between, namely the Gerusian and Isean. The fire spread widely, first due to the force of the wind, and then due to the inaction of the people, who, as it is well known, remained idle and immobile as spectators of such a great disaster. Furthermore, there was no firefighting equipment anywhere in public places, no buckets, no hooks, and ultimately no tools to control the fires. These things indeed, as I have already ordered, will be provided; however, my lord, consider whether you think it necessary to establish a guild of craftsmen, limited to only 150 men. I will ensure that no one is admitted except a craftsman, and they shall not use the privilege granted to them for any other purpose. It will not be difficult to oversee such a small number
