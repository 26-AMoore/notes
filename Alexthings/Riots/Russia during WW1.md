Not powerful

Nicholas still sucks
1917 - Protests, Czar Abdicates
The Czars Abdication ends the Romanov dynasty
Womens March (just like france) (Febuary Rev)
Meanwhile Czar Nicholas is on the front
He gets on a train to head home
Gets stopped by his own military
Forced to step down
and takes son with him
Ends the Romanov dynasty

Petrograd Soviet (Soviet of the capital)
That duma is called: Provisional Government

Power vaccum now
There are two governments
Barely anything gets done
Still at war

Lenin returns
Germany Likes Lenin
Lenin goes to Russia by first going through Finland

Big question:
Will the Bolshviks support the war
Will they participate
Will they try to overthrow it - YES, YES THEY DO

Leader of Provisional Government is Krensky

"The people need peace; the peopel need bread; the people need land. And they give you war, hunger, no bread."
"We must fight for the socialist revolution, fight to the end, until the complete victory of the proletariat"
"Long live the worldwide socialist revolution!"

from fitz
"Lenin is now trying to operate through the Soviet rather than the Bolshviks"

Situatiion seriuos, there is anarchy in the capital, governmnt paralysed. chaotic shooting in the streets - Mikhail Rodzianko chariman of the duma
