### $$Pressure = \sigma = \frac{Force}{Area}$$
# Mainly from depth
Force experienced by an object when submerged do to weight of the fluid above
$$\sigma = \rho*g*height$$

## This equation is only valid for liquids that have a constant density, Under those conditions, the liquid is in-compressible
#### Important to know
Atmospheric Pressure = 101.3 kPa
1 bar = 100 kPa
$$\sigma_{absolute}=\sigma_{atmosphere}+\sigma_{gage}$$
