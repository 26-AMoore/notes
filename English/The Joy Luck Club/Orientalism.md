**Orientalism**, at least in relation to *The Joy Luck Club* is the stereotyping of Asian-American Cultures by flattening differences between various Asian cultures. **Orientalist** ideas tend to **emphasize aspects** of cultures **which appear strange** or exotic.

Orientalism is rooted in a **misunderstanding of values different from one's own**. For example, a snooty professor may attend a night club and not understand the music, the dances, and the general "informal" culture. In the same way, a British scholar might study and observe Eastern cultures, but come away with misconceived ideas, **failing to understand the backgrounds and the history** from which the culture came.

When the orientalist misconceives ideas about many cultures, they may *simplify* and merge cultural ideas into an **appropriated, stereotypical worldview**.

This appropriaton can be seen in films like *Aladdin*, where the titular character dons a traditionally Turkish outfit, while Jasmine wears something with more of an Indian style, showing that the art directors clearly do not understand the middle east.
