# Concept
## Centripetal
- Centripetal - Means center-seeking
- Centripetal force is always towards the center
## Rotation
- An object rotates around an axis within the object
- For example, a day on earth is one rotation
## Revolution
- An object rotates around an axis not within the object
- A year on earth is one revolution
## Frequency
- Cycles per time
## Period
- Time per cycle

## Another way to think about velocity
Acceleration
$$a_c=\frac{v^2}{r} $$
Velocity
$$v=\frac{2\pi r}{T}=2\pi rf$$
Combo
$$a_c=\frac{v^2}{r} =\frac{(\frac{2\pi r}{T})^2}{r} $$
$$a_c=\frac{4\pi ^2 r}{T^2} = 4\pi^2rf^2$$
T = period
Newtons second law style "F=ma"
$$\sum F_c = m4\pi ^2rf^2$$

### More equations
##### LEVEL CURVE
$$\sum F = f_c = f_f = ma_c$$
$$f_f = \mu mg = ma_c$$
THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART:
$$\mu g = a_c$$
g = gravity
#### Bank / bent curve
no friction for it anymore
break apart $f_n$ not $f_w$ , now there is $f_{nx}$ $= f_{rx}\sin(\theta) = f_c$ and $f_{ny}$  = $f_{ny}\sin(\theta)$ only $f_{nx}$ is important
$f_n = f_r$
$f_y = 0$ <- important
**final**
$$a_c = g\tan(\theta)$$
(also works for objects on a conicle way) (because angle)
g = grav
ac = ac
##### turkish twister
$$a_c = \frac{g}{\mu}$$
