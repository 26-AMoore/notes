# A volt is the electrical potential between two points when 1 [[Ampere]] dissipates 1 [[Watt]] of [[Power]] between those points
## Equation
$$V=\frac{J}{C}=\frac{power}{current}=\frac{W}{A}$$
J = [[Joule]]
C = [[Coulomb]]
V = [[Volts]]
W = [[Watt|Watts]]
A = [[Ampere|Amps]]
$$V=A*\Omega$$
V = [[Volts]]
A = [[Ampere|Amps]]
$\Omega$ = [[Ohms]]
