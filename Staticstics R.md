# Value to describe how correlated a scatter plot is 

$$r=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum\left( \frac{x-\bar{x}}{s_{x}} \right)\left( \frac{y-\bar{y}}{s_{y}} \right)$$
unitless

r^2 is the percentage of the variation on the y that can be explained by diff in the x

4 things when describing scatterplot:
- direction
- positive or negative
- form
- linear or curved (non-linear)
- strength
- weak, moderate, strong
