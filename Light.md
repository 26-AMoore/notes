#light #physics 
# Light is energy carried in an electromagnetic wave that is made of vibrating electric charges in atoms
It carries the characteristics of waves and streams, so it is safe to say that light travels in a straight line at a constant speed

### Its pretty fast
$$c=3.0*10^8\ m/s$$

# Other terms
## Object
The original object which is hit by light [[Rays]]
### Image -- [[Image]]
The 'picture' of the Object

$$D_{o}=D_{i}$$

### Equations
Center of curvature
$$C=2f$$
Lens equation
$$\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{d_{o}}+\frac{1}{d_{i}}$$
Magnification
$$mag=\frac{d_{i}}{d_{o}}=-\frac{h_{i}}{h_{o}}$$
$\__{i}$ is image
$\__{o}$ is object

Notes:
• Concave mirror will have a POSITIVE focal length (+f).
• Convex mirror will have a NEGATIVE focal length (-f).
• The sign of the focal length (f) must be included in the lens equation.
• A concave mirror can produce REAL and VIRTUAL images.
• A convex mirror can only produce VIRTUAL images.
• Real images will have a POSITIVE IMAGE DISTANCE (di) and be found
on the same side as the object.
• Virtual images will have a NEGATIVE IMAGE DISTANCE (di) and be
found on the opposite side as the object (in the mirror).
