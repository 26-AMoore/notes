Coulombs establish an equation relating the amount of charge to the resultant force [[Fundamental rule of Electrostatics]]

## Equation
$$F = k\frac{q_1*q_2}{d^2}$$
F = [[Force]]
k = [[Coulombs constant]] ($Nm^2/C^2$)  $k=9.0*10^9$
q = [[Charge]] (C)
d = distance between charges (m)

If the result is positive, the particles are repelling, if it is negative, they are pulling in
