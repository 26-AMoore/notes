# $f(x)=kx$
k is spring constant, which is based on the spring

## Three distinct points in the movement

### For [[Equilibrium Point]]
$$F_{w}=F_{s}$$
Even if there is motion, [[Acceleration]] is zero, but [[Velocity]] is at maximum
### For Above
$$F_{w}>F_{s}$$
$\sum F \ne 0$ is where velocity is zero but at max acceleration

### For Below
$$F_{w}<F_{s}$$
$\sum F \ne 0$ is where velocity is zero but at max acceleration

### Useful Equations
$$\sum F=-k \Delta x$$
$\Delta x$ is distance from [[Equilibrium Point]]
Force is the force on the hanging mass

$$T=2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{m}{k} }$$
T = [[Period]]
m is in kg


# For Pendulum
#### $$T=2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{l}{g} }$$
l is length of string (m)
g is gravity
