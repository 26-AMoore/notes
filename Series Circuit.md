# A Circuit that has only one path for [[Current]] to flow through
### [[Current]] is constant
$$I_T=I_1 = I_2 = I_3 = I_4 +\ ...$$
### The sum of the voltage across the circuit is equal to the total voltage [[Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]]
$$\Sigma V =V_1+V_2+V_3+V_4+\ ...$$
### The sum of the individual [[Resistance]] in the [[Circuits]] will add up to the total [[Resistance]] in the [[Circuits]]
$$\Sigma R =R_1+R_2+R_3+R_4+\ ...$$
