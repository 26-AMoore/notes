### Equations
$$\Sigma W = -\Delta U = \Delta E = \Delta KE+\Delta PE$$

$$W=f\cdot d$$
dot product of [[Force]] and [[Distance]]
only true if force is constant 
force and distance are in the same direction
cause its really 
$$W=\int F(x)dx$$
with an additional integral for each dimension in the problem

Now as a function of velocity
$$W=\int mvdv$$
