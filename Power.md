# Power is the rate [[Energy]] is expended, measured in [[Watt]]
### Equation
$$Power=\frac{Work}{Time}=\frac{W}{T}$$
P = Power in [[Watt]]
W = [[Work]] in [[Joule]]
T = Time in seconds

### For Electronics
$$P = IV$$
$$P = I^2R$$
$$P=\frac{V^2}{R}$$
P = Power in [[Watt]]
I = [[Current]] in [[Ampere]]
V = [[Volts]]
R = [[Resistance]] in [[Ohms]]
