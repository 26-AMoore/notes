# Momentum 
$$ p = mv$$
m = mass (kg)
v = velocity-[[Constant Acceleration Equations]]
p = Ns (newton seconds)
- vector quantity
- same direction as velocity

conservative situation
$$\sum p_i = \sum p_v$$
two types of collisions
- elastic
	- conserves momentum
	- also conserves energy
	- they bounce

- inelastic
	- conserves momentum
	- dont move?????

non conservative
# Impulse
Change in momentum
Vector quantity (same as veloctiy) $J_x\ \&\ J_y$  
$$J = F\Delta t$$
also
$$J=\Delta p = m(v_f-v_i)$$
J = impulse (Ns)
f = force
t = time?
m = mass kg !sys mass

if
- elastic
- one at rest
- 1 dimensional
$$v_{1f} = \frac{m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_2}v_{1i}$$
$$v_{2f} = \frac{2m_1}{m_1+m_2}v_{1i}$$
