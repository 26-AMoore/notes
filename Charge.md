# Objects can have a charge

## Charge is always conserved

Objects always want an equal charge to their environment, when two objects touch, they exchange [[Electrons]] to try and balance their charges

Charge is from the particles in [[Atoms]] and the pieces that make them up
- [[Electrons]] are Negatively charged, [[Protons]] are positively charged

## Charges are one of
- Positive
	- Less [[Electrons]]
- Negative
	- More [[Electrons]]
- Neutral
	- Even amount

## Some examples of charge exchange
- Rubber on fur
	- Rubber holds electrons better than fur, so rubber gains electrons fro the fur and becomes more negatively charged
- Glass on Silk
	- Silk holds electrons better than glass, so they exchange electrons so silk becomes more negatively charged
