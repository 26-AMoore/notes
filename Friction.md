#physics 
# Anytime two objects move against each other there is Friction in the opposing direction
$$F_{f} = \mu * F_{n}$$
[[Force]] normal = force from the surface onto the object
$\mu$ = The ? of friction, ratio for the two objects, generally from 

# Kinetic v. [[Static]] friction
## Kinetic friction
Friction when an object is in motion
## Static
Friction when an object is at rest, equation gives the MAXIMUM static friction
$\mu_{s}$ Always greater than $\mu_{k}$
