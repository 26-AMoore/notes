#### General:
Latin has three moods or “manners of verbal action”. The indicative mood is used for statements of fact and questions. The imperative mood expresses a command. The subjunctive is used to express idea, intent, desire, uncertainty, potentiality, or anticipation. The subjunctive is found primarily in subordinate clauses, but some independent uses also exist. Its use is subtle and best learned from long exposure to the original texts. But general rules do exist.


##### Jussive and Hortatory Subjunctive:
Used to express a command or an exhortation:
###### The Jussive (iubeo, -ere, iussi, iussus) 
Veniat! Let him come! (Jussive)
If 3rd person use this
###### Hortatory (hortor, -ari, -atus sum)
Veniamus! Let’s come! (Hortatory)
If 1st person use this

The negative is introduced by ne: Ne hoc faciat! Let him not do this!

##### Potential Subjunctive:
The subjunctive may be used to express an action which might possibly occur:
	Haec credas. You might believe these things.
	Dicas eum hominem bonum esse. You might say he is a good man.

Past potentiality is expressed by the imperfect subjunctive:
	Crederes eum hominem bonum esse. You might have believed he was a good man.

Present translates to "Might"
Imperfect translated to "Might have"

##### Deliberative Subjunctive:
The present and imperfect subjunctives are used to deliberate about something, often in a rhetorical question:
	Quid faciam? What should I do?
	Quid facerem? What should I have done?

The negative is introduced by non.

##### Optative Subjunctive
The Optative (opto -are) is used for a future wish capable of fulfillment, introduced by utinam or ut (negative utinam ne or ne):
	__Utinam__ veniat! Would that he may come!
	__Utinam__ ne veniat! Would that he may not come!

Contrary to fact wishes use the imperfect subjunctive for present time and pluperfect subjunctive for past time:
	__Utinam__ veniret! Would that he were coming (but he is not). 
	__Utinam__ venisset! Would that he had come (but he did not).
