# A way to define where the holes are
## Street Math
Can you draw the graph without lifting your pencil

Hole -> Removable discontinuity
Jump -> Non-removable discontinuity, also called "essential"
Infinite -> Non-removable discontinuity (asymptotic)

Essential Discontinuity 
$$y=\frac{1}{x-2}-3x$$

Hole at 6, Asymptotic at -1
$$f(x)=\frac{x^2+x+6}{x^2-5x-6}$$
$$f(x)=\frac{(x-6)(x-2)}{(x-6)(x+1)}$$

Jump at 5, Asymptotic at -2, 2 
$$g(x)=\{\begin{array}{}
 \frac{5}{x^2-4},\  x<5 \\
 \ 2x-11, \ x\geq 5\ 
\end{array} \}$$
