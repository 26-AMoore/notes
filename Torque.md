# A twisting force
Newtons second law
$$\sum\tau=I\alpha$$
Torque is the cross product of $f$ and $d$
$$\tau=F*d$$
$\tau$ = torque, Nm
$F$ = force, N
d = distance m


$$\sum \tau =\tau_{F1}+\tau_{F2}+\tau_{F_{3}}+\ . . .$$
Force and distance are perpendicular
Torque is a vector quantity, CCW is positive and CW is negative [[Right Hand Rule]]
Torque is additive

When solving direction, remember the [[Right Hand Rule]] and do not worry about signs
