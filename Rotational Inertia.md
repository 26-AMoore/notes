# An objects resistance to change in rotational motion

$$I=\sum(m_{i}r_{i}^2)$$
I = moment of inertia (kg m^2)
m = mass (kg)
r = radius (m)

disk
$$I=\frac{1}{2}mr^2$$

## The shape of an object is as important as the mass of an object
because now its relative to r

# Thankfully shapes pre-solved

# Parallel Axis Theorem
$$I=I + m*d^2$$
d or h = distance from usual axis of rotation
I = common [[Inertia]] equation
