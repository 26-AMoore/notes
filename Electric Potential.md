# A per [[charge]] relationship for a point
### When you remove a charge from [[Electric Potential Energy]]
### Equation
$$EP = V = k\frac{q_s}{r}$$
V = [[Volts]] or [[Joule]] / [[Coulomb]]
q = [[Charge]]
r = Distance [[Meter]]
### Also scalar, no direction
### We generally care about the $\Delta$, a prediction of how much energy is needed to move between two points
$$\Delta V = V_f-V_i$$
V = [[Joule]]/[[Coulomb]] or [[Volts]]
