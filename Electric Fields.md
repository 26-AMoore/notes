# A prediction of [[Force]]
## Based on three things
- Type of [[Charge]] (+/-)
- Size of [[Charge]]
- Distance between [[Charge|Charges]]

## Measured in [[Newtons|N]]/[[Coulomb|C]]
- How many [[Newtons]] of [[Force]] you get for a [[Charge]] 

## Equation
### Known Test charge
$$E=\frac{F}{q_0}$$
E = [[Electric Fields|Electric Field]]
F = [[Force]]
$q_0$ = Test charge ([[Coulomb|C]])

### Can also be written
$$F=q_0E$$

### Known Source Charge
$$E=k\frac{q_s}{d^2}$$
E = [[Electric Fields|Electric Field]]
$q_s$ = Source charge ([[Coulomb|C]])
d = Distance ([[Meter|M]])
