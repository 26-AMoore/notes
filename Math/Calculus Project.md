# Objective
Prove that the area of a circle, with radius $r$, is equal to $\pi{r}^2$

# Mathematical Information
- All angles are in **radians**
- For all polygons decribed, each vertex is $r$ units distanced from the origin 

# Outline
#### Suppose the following:
$$A_N(r)=\text{The area of a regular $N$-sided polygon}$$
#### This implies:
$$\lim_{N\rightarrow{\infty}}A_N(r)=\text{The area of a circle with radius $r$}$$
#### Objective
$$\text{Find }A_N(r)\text{ and solve for }\lim_{N\rightarrow{\infty}}A_N(r)$$
