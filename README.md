# This is the entirety of my notes throughout all of my high school time at the Derryfield school
This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it is all that I took notes on
Thank you to asmi57 for some of their notes and for getting me to use obsidian to log all of them in the first place
They should all just be browse-able through the github website if you want, but some LaTeX might not render correctly, along with images and links
# THESE NOTES ARE NOT NECESSARILY FULLY CORRECT, OR WELL FORMATTED
I have had these since sophomore year, and I have gone through different organization systems, there might also be misspellings or quirks of my own notation, I frankly **DO NOT CARE** go make your own notes if you want
