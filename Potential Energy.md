#physics 
# Stored [[Energy]] from gravity
### Generally a prediction of [[Work]]
$$-\Sigma W = \Delta U$$
W = [[Work]]
U = [[Energy]]

### Gravity
$$PE=mgh$$
### Spring -- [[Hookes Law Spring]]
$$PE_{S}=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
k = spring constant (N/m^2) (normally realllllllllllyyy big)
x = deformation (m) how much it elongated or compressed
