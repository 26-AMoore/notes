# Stored [[Energy]] from gravity
### Generally a prediction of [[Work]]
$$-\Sigma W = \Delta U$$
W = [[Work]]
U = [[Energy]]

### Gravity - baby
$$PE=mgh$$
Only useful when g is constant

### Gravity - changing G
$$U=-G {\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r}}$$ 
Looks like force but it is not
Only works for r where $r > radius$ of body
G is [[Universal Gravitation Constant]]
U is always negative because $r_{\infty} = U_{\infty} = 0$

When there are multiple objects, U is additive
$$U=-(G {\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r}}+G {\frac{m_{1}m_{3}}{r}}+G {\frac{m_{2}m_{3}}{r}})$$ 

### Spring -- [[Hookes Law Spring]]
$$PE_{S}=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
k = spring constant (N/m^2) (normally realllllllllllyyy big)
x = deformation (m) how much it elongated or compressed
