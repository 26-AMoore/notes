# A problem with a relationship between two variables means there is a relationship between two [[Derivative]]s

### Example with a sphere
Getting increase of radius from an increasing volume
Given $\frac{dV}{dt}=5$, What is $\frac{dr}{dt}$ **when $r = 2$**
(all questions can be simplified to this form)
$$V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$$
Take derivative
$$\frac{dV}{dt}=\frac{4}{3}\pi*3r^2*\frac{dr}{dt}$$
Fill known values
$$5=\frac{4}{3}\pi*3*2^2*\frac{dr}{dt}$$
$$\frac{dr}{dt}=\frac{5}{16\pi}$$
**Key takeaway is that all values are based on time**
