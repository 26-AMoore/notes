# Concept
In [[Sir Isaac Newton]]'s book, *Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica*, he posits the following law of motion:

"**The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.**"

# Mathematical Implications
His law is commonly described with the following equation:
$$\Sigma{F}=ma$$
Where:
$\Sigma{F}$ = the sum of forces acting on the object
$m$ = the mass of the object
$a$ = the acceleration the object experiences

# Newtons
A **newton** is a unit of measurement for **force**. It is a composition of acceleration and mass.

$$N = \frac{kg\cdot m}{s^2}$$
Or, verbally, 1 **newton** is equal to 1 **kilogram meter per seconds squared**. 1 newton is the amount of force needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass by 1 meter per second, every second.
