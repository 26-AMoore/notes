# Concept
In [[Sir Isaac Newton]]'s book, *Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica*, he posits the following law of motion:

"**To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction; or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts**"

# Implications
As **energy can not be created**, all of the energy in a system is simply transferred; the force vector applied unto a body is balanced by an **opposite** force vector acting on the exact point as the initial force.

As all motion is relative, saying that **Object A acts on Object B** implies that <span style="color:#8fbcbb;font-weight:bold">Object B acts on Object A</span>

#### The Contact Rule
For a force to be applied between two objects **there must be contact** between them. The **exceptions** are **gravity** and **magnetism**.
