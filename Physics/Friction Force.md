Microscopically, surfaces are not flat. Surfaces have tiny teensy-weensy teeny roughness and grit. When two surfaces are colliding (have forces applied into one another), their roughnesses interlock and cause a force.

# Calculation
The **friction force** generated between two surfaces is a function of the force applied in the *normal* direction to the surfaces
$$\begin{array}{l}
F_f=\mu\cdot F_P\\
\end{array}$$
$\mu$ (mu) is the **coefficient of friction**, a special number which depends on the surfaces in question.

# Types of Friction
### Static Friction
Static friction is friction experienced by two surfaces that do NOT move relative to each other (stationary condition)
$$F_{fs}=\mu_s\cdot F_N$$
	where
    $F_{fs}$ = Force-friction statis
	$F_N$ = Force in the normal direction
	$\mu_s$ = the coefficient of friction for static objects
This friction force is only applied when not moving; a.k.a. the friction force outweighs other applied forces, keeping it stationary

### Kinetic Friction
Kinetic friction the the normal friction that occurs between two abjects in motion against reach other.
$$F_{fk}=\mu_k\cdot{F_N}$$

### Air Resistance
**Air Resistance** is a special case of friction, where a person is colliding with the *air*. The force of air resistance depends on three factors:
- Velocity
- Surface Area
- Air Density
