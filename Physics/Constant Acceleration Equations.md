# Concept
The **constant acceleration equations** are a set of equations that describe motion of a body in situations where the **acceleration** of the body **does not change**.

# Origin
All constant acceleration equations are derived from the definitions of **velocity** and **acceleration**.

Velocity is the measurement of change in motion over a period of time
$d_f = v\cdot{t} + d_i$
$\Delta{d} = v\cdot{t}$

Acceleration is the measurement of change in velocity over a period of time
$v_f = a\cdot{t} + v_i$
$\Delta{v} = a\cdot{t}$

# Equation 1
$$v_f = v_i + a \cdot t$$
This equation is derived from the definition of acceleration; over a period time, the acceleration changes the velocity of a body.

# Equation 2
$$ \Delta d = \frac{1}{2}(v_i + v_f)\cdot t$$
With $\frac{1}{2}(v_i+v_f)$ being the definition of **average velocity**, multiplying by $t$ results in the total distance.

# Equation 3
$$\Delta{d}=v_it+\frac{1}{2}at^2$$
Derived from equation 2, differentiating this equation results in equation 1; this makes sense, as the derivative of distance is velocity.

# Equation 4
$$v_f^2-v_i^2=2a(\Delta{d})$$
