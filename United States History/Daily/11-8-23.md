# Market Revolution
The market revolution was a bloodless, but incredibly influential period in America. It occured between the 1810s and the Civil War.
New tech in transportation and communication allowed goods to be *way* more easily and quickly. Better roads, canals, **steam boats**! The Eerie Canal linked NY to the Great Lakes, making it an economic powerhouse. Rails, telegrams, boats, canals, factories! This was an early industrial revolution.
All of this infrastructure requires *investments*. In the 1830s, states began passing laws to make creating corporations easier.
