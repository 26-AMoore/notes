# Questions for your consideration...
- How did the role of slaves and indentured servants change as a result of Bacon's Rebellion?
- Why did slavery became increasingly racial from the 1700s onwards?


# Big Picture
- Haves vs Have-Nots
	- Slaves / Freedmen vs Landowners
- Us vs Them
	- 

# Bacon Rebellion
- Where?
	- Chesapeake Bay
- Who?
	- "Freed"men
	- Landowners
	- Nathaniel Bacon
- Why?
	- Population increase was stressing the economy
	- Land was required to vote (anger)
	- Landowners don't wanna sell land
		- Demand is high but supply is low :(
  
# Are indentured servants free?
Short answer: **NO**
Indentured == Indebted
Indebted == No Money && No Land
