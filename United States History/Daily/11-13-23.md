# Questions to Consider
- How did politics change during the election of 1828?
- How did US expansion impact relations with Native Americans?
- How should we think of this time period? What do these changes signify?

# The Corrupt Bargain

## The 1824 Election
- John Q. Adams
- Henry Clay
- Andrew Jackson
- Crawford
JQA and Jackson tie electorally, but Jackson wins popular vote. As it was a tie, the choice goes to the House of Representatives. Clay, being Speaker of the House, must make this call (as the loser of the election).

## The Two-Party System is Back
With the election being decided by the House, people thought it was undemocratic. The Jacksonian-Democratic party arises in opposition to the Republican party.

| Party                 | Beliefs                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Jacksonian-Democratic | States' Rights            |
| National-Republican   | Strong Federal Government |
