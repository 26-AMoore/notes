# A [[Circuits]] that has multiple paths for [[Current]] to flow through
### The [[Current]] gets divided across all possible paths, no path will experience the total [[Current]]

### [[Volts]] are measured across each [[Component]], and are constant across the [[Circuits]]
$$V_T=V_1 = V_2 = V_3 = V_4 +\ ...$$
### [[Current]] is measured through each [[Component]], and the [[Current]] is summed [[Kirchhoff's Current Law]]
$$I_T=I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + I_4 +\ ...$$
### [[Resistance]] is equal to the sum of the reciprocals
$$\frac{1}{R_T}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3}+\frac{1}{R_4}+\ ...$$
